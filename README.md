# WorkOS

WorkOS is a robust set of APIs designed to empower developers in making their applications enterprise-ready. These APIs streamline the integration of enterprise features, ensuring that your app is equipped to meet the demands of corporate environments. From single sign-on (SSO) to directory integrations, WorkOS accelerates the development of SaaS applications, providing a seamless experience for both developers and end-users.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js (for the backend API)
- React (or another frontend framework/library)
- OAuth 2.0 (for authentication)
- GraphQL (for flexible and efficient APIs)
- [Any additional libraries or tools]

## Key Features

- Single Sign-On (SSO): Implement secure and easy-to-use SSO functionality for your application.
- Directory Integrations: Seamlessly integrate with popular directories like Active Directory and LDAP.
- Audit Logs: Keep track of user activities and generate detailed audit logs for compliance.
- User Provisioning and Deprovisioning: Automate user management workflows for efficiency and security.
- Admin Dashboard: Provide administrators with a dedicated dashboard for managing enterprise settings.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following key components:

- `/server`: Backend API built with Express.js, handling authentication, directory integrations, and audit logs.
- `/client`: Frontend code for the WorkOS admin dashboard, built with React.
- `/oauth`: OAuth 2.0 server for secure authentication.
- `/graphql`: GraphQL API for flexible data queries.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `/server` directory and run `npm install` to install backend dependencies.
3. Set up your OAuth credentials and configure directory integrations.
4. Run the server with `npm start`.
5. Navigate to the `/client` directory and run `npm install` to install frontend dependencies.
6. Start the frontend with `npm start`.

## Usage Examples

```javascript
// Example code snippet for initiating an OAuth login with WorkOS
const workOS = require('workos');

const oauthURL = workOS.generateOAuthURL({
  clientID: 'your-client-id',
  redirectURI: 'your-redirect-uri',
  domain: 'enterprise-domain.com',
});

console.log(oauthURL);
```
